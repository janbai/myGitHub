/* 
 â–  Declaring an Interface 
 
1- generally defining a contract for what a class can do, without saying anything about how the class will do it.
2- generally has only abstract methods
3- Interfaces can be implemented by any class and from any inheritance tree.
4- All interface methods are implicitly public. Unless declared as default or static, 
5- they are also implicitly abstract
6- All variables defined in an interface must be public, static, and final
7- methods cannot be marked final, strictfp, or native.
8- An interface can extend one or more other interfaces.
9- An interface cannot extend anything but another interface.
10-An interface cannot implement another interface or class.
11-An interface must be declared with the keyword interface.
12-Interface types can be used polymorphically
13-Declaring Interface Constants: public static final
14-interface variable is final and can never be given a value by the implementing (or any other) class.
